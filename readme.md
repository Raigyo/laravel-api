*June 2019*

> ðŸ”¨ Laravel - Api. Inpired by the tutorial from [Medium](https://medium.com/employbl/build-an-api-with-laravel-5-7-b3aa16ca2e69). The goal of the exercise is to create a database managed by tinkle and make some unit testing


* * *

[x] Routes (API)

[x] Database model, table and controller (CRUD)

[x] Model Factories

[x] Seeders

[x] Eloquent ORM & Tinker

[x] Unit testing (PHP Unit)

## Features

- CRUD using Tinker
- Unit testing

## Installation

You will need a server to run the application and PHP. For instance Lamp.
You also will need composer if you want to add dependencies.

To launch the server, go on the directory of this app the launch:

`$ php artisan serve`

To test the app, you can use the Artisan Tinker command. This allows you to directly view and manipulate your database.

### Seed the database

`$ php artisan db:seed`

### Use Tinker

`$ php artisan tinker`

**Create**

~~~~
>>> $p = new App\Task;

>>> $p->title = 'New title';

>>> $p->description = 'New descritpion';

>>> $p->save();
~~~~

**Read**

`>>> $p = \App\Task::all();`

or

`>>> $p = \App\Task::findorFail(1);`

where '1' is the id number.

**Update**

~~~~
>>> $p = \App\Task::findorFail(11);

>>> $p->title = "Updated title";

>>> $p->description = "Updated description";`

>>> $p->save();
~~~~

**Delete**
~~~~
>>> $p = \App\Task::findorFail(12);

>>> $p ->delete();
~~~~

or

`>>> $p ->forceDelete();`


### Use PHP Unit

Create a test 'UserTest' in the Feature directory...

`$ php artisan make:test UserTest`

Create a test 'UserTest' in the Unit directory...

`$ php artisan make:test UserTest --unit`

In this app, the test has already been created: tests/Feature/TaskTest.php

Launch a test:

`$ vendor/bin/phpunit`

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
